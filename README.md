#NuclearJS addons for React

##Examples

Check out these [examples](https://github.com/optimizely/nuclear-js/tree/master/examples)

##Tests

Browser tests spin up `npm run browser-tests` it will launch a webpack dev server and open http://localhost:8080/tests.runner.html, change the port with `npm run browsers-tests -- --port=#PORT`.

Node tests needs io.js (because of jsdom@5), run `npm tests` or `npm run watch` for TDD.
